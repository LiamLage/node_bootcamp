### **Front-End vs Back-End Web Development**

In general front-end dev refers to everything that happens within the browser; designing & building the website.
Basic front-end stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Back-end refers to everything that happens server-side. A static server will serve static files via HTTP while a dynamic
server is also capable of running our application to communicate with DB etc.

In this course we will be using Node.js & mongoDB in our back-end stack.

### **Static vs Dynamic vs API**

Dynamic websites usually use a database, together with an application, they render the website with new information dynamically each time a request is made.
